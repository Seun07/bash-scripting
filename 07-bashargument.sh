#./bashargument.sh your_argument
#In the script, we can then use $1 in order to reference the first argument that we specified.

#If we pass a second argument, it would be available as $2 and so on.

#Let's create a short script called arguments.sh as an example:

#!/bin/bash

echo "Argument one is $1"
echo "Argument two is $2"
echo "Argument three is $3"



#passw arguments now
